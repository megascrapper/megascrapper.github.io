Apple thinks that you don't need to know the how much the battery is charged on the lock screen. Not even a rough estimate of how much the battery is charged, let alone the exact percentage. I have to unlock my laptop just to see the battery percentage. This is one of the several things Apple inexplicably removed in macOS Big Sur. I mean, you have a whole flippin screen for it! what's the excuse really?

Just in case I was hallucinating, you can see the [battery percentage from the lock screen](https://www.appleauthority.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/macos-catalina-startup-screen-login.jpg) in Catalina and before.
