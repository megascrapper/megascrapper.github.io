Who puts this thing at the corner of the site and thinks "yep, this is definitely not distracting at all"? My eyes always end up focusing on the bouncy badge instead of whatever I was trying to look at.

Bonus point: If you click the chat button thing (which seems to be the only way to dismiss the badge) it will play some notification tone that is not at all surprising or obnoxious. And sometimes you have to do it twice to make the badge disappear.
